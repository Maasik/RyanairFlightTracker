# RyanairFlightTracker
Created as a college project. An Android application built using Android Studio. This app takes a Ryanair flight number and date and then shows the user a live location of the aircraft on a map which updates every 30 seconds. It also includes the user's location and the departure and arrival airport. Includes QR reader and option to save flight lists.
